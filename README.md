It's me, Deepak. you've probably never heard of me. And I've never thought of writing a README for myself. Usually READMEs are written for applications and softwares, but here I'm writing a README about me. By the way I'm a Java FullStack Developer. Currently I'm seeking for an entry-level position.

Stay tuned for more projects.

If you like my project, give a huge kick on the Star.

            -Have a nice day :)
