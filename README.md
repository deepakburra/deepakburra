I am from Mars!

It's me, Deepak. you've probably never heard of me. And I've never thought of writing a README for myself. Usually READMEs are written for applications and softwares, but here I'm writing a README about me. By the way I'm a Java FullStack Developer. Currently I'm seeking for a entry-level position. 

Stay tuned for more projects.

Reach me @ deepakburra84@gmail.com

            -Have a nice day :)
